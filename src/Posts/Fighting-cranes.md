# How to make cranes fight? Prototyping a very simple "fighting" game

when both opponents areas overlap, the first one to press the flip (kind of a non violent kick action) wins the round. I tried and it looks fun. Let me know what you think. Feel free to follow the game on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitamelni/Cute-Crainz). Version 0.1:
